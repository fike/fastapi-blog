# A FastAPI sample

This a FastAPI project for blog backend to learn purpose.

## Dependencies

* SQLAlmechy
* Alembic for migrations
* OpenTelemtry for instrumentation
* Docker
* Docker-Compose
* Jaeger
* Make

## How to use

Use make command to run inside a docker container, it'll expose the port 8000 and access using URL: `http://localhost:8000`. I'm not sure if a makefile run in the Powershell, probably yes but I suggest to use [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/install-win10).

**Up and run**:

```bash
make dev-up
```

This repo is instrumented by OpenTelemtry and export metric to Jaeger that start together the app by Docker-Compose, to access: `http://localhost:16686/`

### Tests

To run tests will up a postgresql container and expose 5433 port to populate. The report will write in htmlcov dir.

```bash
make test-local
```
